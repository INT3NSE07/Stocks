stocks in portfolio readonly - immutability. return all new objects
-- portfoliotype validation
ticker validation
market cap - validate number of stocks

This is a design decisions, up to you. If your program is doing things automatically it would be nice to let the user know.
addStock move to createPortfolio - prevents addStock from being called independently
createPortfolio - hashmap<ticker, quantity> - add same stock added twice
empty portfolio?
weekends - return friday value
readRecords CSV - take predicate?
-- create a portfolio by providing a file
map change to stock object
There is one restriction that your program must support: most brokers do not allow a client to directly purchase a fractional amount of shares - add validation in controller
rename to impl

read is fine from any source. But write is restricted to text based stream because of human readable limitation.
