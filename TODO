-limitations
read is fine from any source. But write is restricted to text based stream because of human readable limitation.
number of shares - INT.MAX
market cap - validate number of stocks

validations
SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE symbol = 'AAPL' and date <= sell_date ORDER BY date
// number of stocks available
buy quantity - sell quantity


SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE symbol = 'AAPL' and date > sell_date
if count > 0
 invalid


res = SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE symbol = 'AAPL'
buy = res.filter(date <= sell_date)
