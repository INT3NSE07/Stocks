A text description (SETUP-README.txt) in the res folder of how exactly to run your program from the JAR file. If you require the jar file to be in a specific folder, or require other files with it, please include these directions here. You should also include detailed instructions on how to run your program to create a portfolio with 3 different stocks, a second portfolio with 2 different stocks and query their value on a specific date. We will run your program with this data to begin grading. You should also include a list of stocks that your program supports, along with dates on which its value can be determined (if there are restrictions in your program about which data is available).
